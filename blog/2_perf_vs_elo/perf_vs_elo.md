# Plotting the performance of openings VS Elo with an Open Source Tool.

The goal is to see how an opening's stats change across different Elo ratings. The charts visualize its performance (as Expected Elo Gain / 100 Games), its reachability (how often you can steer the game into it), its overall popularity, and a "Theory Advantage" metric to quantify its surprise value.

Hi everyone,

Following up on [my recent blog](https://lichess.org/@/LKama/blog/finding-opening-gold-a-statistical-hunt-for-wicked-lines/c0x9TFV7) introducing the [open source tool WickedLines](https://github.com/RemiFabre/WickedLines/tree/main), I've released an update that can now generate detailed charts to assess an opening's performance.

This has been a fun project, and I'm thinking about where to take it next. I'd love to get your thoughts on a few ideas:

* A Website: Would you be interested in a website that provides this type of statistical data for more openings?
* Repertoire Analytics: What about a feature where you input your opening repertoire, and the tool provides analytics on it? It could provide the expected performance score of your entire repertoire at a given Elo and the "holes" in your prep, showing the percentage of common opponent moves you don't have a response for.
* Repertoire Suggestions: Would a tool that suggests openings based on stats and personal preferences (e.g., tactical, solid) be useful?
* The Charts Themselves: Is the data presented clearly? Are the logos for each opening a good idea or just clutter?

Any feedback on these ideas or the chart design would be helpful.

Thanks!
